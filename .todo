BLACKMIND TODO
    - Prototype Phase
        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - DAY TASKS
                - Aiming to get all of the following donezo by Sunday (23rd) so that I have a week to updoot the script
                    and write out the doccos. Then, if I can do that, I'm a month ahead of schedule, and can start working
                    on the character/background designs for commissioners.

                - Menus:
                    - TUESDAY:
                        - UI for say

                    - WEDNESDAY:
                        - Customise GUI
                            - Dramatic splash opening, like Metallic Rouge
                            - GUI for:
                                - Forget
                                - Mind-reading
                                - Money
                            - Functionality for choosing where to go in the demo
                                - Any other functionality not already implemented - play through the demo and work out where shit is incomplete

                    - THURSDAY:
                        - General:
                            - Return taking us to the main menu from within the main menu should not require us to press Enter again
                        - Save: 
                            - Add in the save functionality on the same bit as we select where to go; then it's
                                helping to test it within the framework of the game
                            - NEW SAVE button when not on main menu
                            - Clicking on an entry lets you save or load
                            - Functionality for naming your saves

            - EVENING TASKS
                - Script needs some touch-ups
                    - Start needs to be punchier. "I'm in a bar. Hey why's she annoyed at me?" isn't a great opening hook
                    - Let's go in a bit more on the precognition making Jack think he's been stabbed; it's a bit brief
                    - I think Jack wanting to fuck Barbara might be the wrong direction to head in. I think let's lean in a bit more into
                        him wanting to steal from her, or find some other flaw to emphasise.
                    - Could an omniscient narrator help with things? I don't want Jack to narrate, but an omniscient narrator might
                        solve some of the problems that I've got.
                - Add in SFX, placeholder music
        - Write up Google Docco with ze plan for friends to assess
            - Also do a Google Forms feedback thingy?
        - Send to friends with link to Google Docco
            - Explicitly mention, "Yes, Jack dies, you play as a new character" in it, and check with them whether they
                think that it's better to end on the moment that it does, or whether it should end with Lloyd being like,
                "I will stop him for you!"
            - Check what they think of the script - is it too short? Does there need to be more in there? Worst case I 
                could throw Lloyd in there but even then that's prolly only another 500 words at most
        - Work out a plan for applying for funding
