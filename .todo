    - Kickstarter Phase
        - Delivery Date: 30/01/2027
        - Should this be shifted around to be before PAX, or just after it? In an ideal world I'll have most of the script written up by PAX, and it'll mostly be programming/voice acting to implement, but
            then if this is before PAX it might not make as much money. Possibly have it running during PAX?
        - I think that the big issue with Many Deaths is that I was selling it too cheap - $5 a copy would require 400 copies to be backed, and I didn't have that pull. 
        - I think that Blankspace is a good one to use as a bit of a template - it's not a very complex game, but they made close to $10K AUD.

            - Tiers:
                - Limited cheapo price ($12)
                - Regular price ($14)
                - Name in credits ($17)
                - Digital artbook ($26) - prolly less relevant for me but I could mock something up
                - Soundtrack ($35) - would need to get something commissioned
                - Cheapo early access ($44) - it looks like this was a beta + fully devved chapter 2 (of 3)
                - Early access ($62)
                - Mousepad ($106) - note that only two people bought this
                - T-shirt ($160)
                - Blackboard message ($500) - only two people bought this but that's $1K right fucking there, and that's for like a single line. I think "heyo you can contribute to the game" stuff tends
                    to go down well and you can justify making it expensive; this is the stuff to try and push
            - Stretch goals:
                - Soundtrack
                - Bigger soundtrack
                - Partial voice acting
                - More partial voice acting

                - I think that my stretch goals would be like more songs/more voice acting/more CGs
    
    - Release Phase:
        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2027
        - Work out the list for this once the other stuff has been sorted; at bare minimum it'll be voice acting
