BLACKMIND TODO
    - Prototype Phase
        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - DAY TASKS
                - Customise GUI
                    - Finish off the main menu, including a "press any key to start" (or maybe just Enter to make it simpler)
                    - GUI for:
                        - Forget
                        - Mind-reading
                        - Money
                    - Functionality for choosing where to go in the demo
                        - Any other functionality not already implemented - play through the demo and work out where shit is incomplete
                    - Yellow/black scheme
                    - Let's assume we're doing a custom pause menu for now (like what I did for AN) but I'll sort it out once I'm working on it

            - EVENING TASKS
                - Draw up an image of Jack for the main menu
                - Draw up backgrounds since I'll need to bloody do it anyway
                - Add in SFX, placeholder music
        - Write up Google Docco with ze plan for friends to assess
            - Also do a Google Forms feedback thingy?
        - Send to friends with link to Google Docco
            - Explicitly mention, "Yes, Jack dies, you play as a new character" in it, and check with them whether they
                think that it's better to end on the moment that it does, or whether it should end with Lloyd being like,
                "I will stop him for you!"
            - Check what they think of the script - is it too short? Does there need to be more in there? Worst case I 
                could throw Lloyd in there but even then that's prolly only another 500 words at most
        - Work out a plan for applying for funding
