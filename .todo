BLACKMIND TODO
    - Prototype Phase
        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - Finish off the functionality for the prologue:
                - Save functionality:
                    - Add within section for where to go
                    - NEW SAVE button when not on main menu
                    - Clicking on an entry lets you save or load
                    - Functionality for naming your saves
        
            - GUI:
                - Use the big buttons for choices
                - Display character names in the history log

            - Fixes:
                - Fix up the count for convo_progress after wiping Barbara's mind
                - Invert the textbox and namebox when reading somebody's mind so that it's more apparent that we're reading their mind

            - Touch-ups:
                - Script:
                    - Start needs to be punchier. "I'm in a bar. Hey why's she annoyed at me?" isn't a great opening hook
                    - Let's go in a bit more on the precognition making Jack think he's been stabbed; it's a bit brief
                    - I think Jack wanting to fuck Barbara might be the wrong direction to head in. I think let's lean in a bit more into
                        him wanting to steal from her, or find some other flaw to emphasise.
                    - Could an omniscient narrator help with things? I don't want Jack to narrate, but an omniscient narrator might
                        solve some of the problems that I've got.
                - Add in red flashes; go through all comments and clear them out
                - Add in SFX, placeholder music
        - Write up Google Docco with ze plan for friends to assess
            - Also do a Google Forms feedback thingy?
        - Send to friends with link to Google Docco
            - Explicitly mention, "Yes, Jack dies, you play as a new character" in it, and check with them whether they
                think that it's better to end on the moment that it does, or whether it should end with Lloyd being like,
                "I will stop him for you!"
            - Check what they think of the script - is it too short? Does there need to be more in there? Worst case I 
                could throw Lloyd in there but even then that's prolly only another 500 words at most
        - Work out a plan for applying for funding
