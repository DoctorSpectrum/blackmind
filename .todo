BLACKMIND TODO
    - Prototype Phase
        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - Prototype:
                - Flow chart with the ability to jump to different spots on it
                    - Each node should load a hidden save for this game
                    - We should use persistent data to determine which nodes are available (or can we just check "does save exist"?)

                    - Okay, so:
                        - We have a persistent variable with game_id that starts at 0
                        - When we start a new game, we save a variable for this game that's game_id + 1, and we increment game_id
                        - When we hit a node, we create a save with an ID of game_id and the node (e.g. 1_a_0_01, 3_b_02_01). Node format is:
                            - [id]_[branch]_[day]_[section]
                        - We have a way to hide these saves from the interface
                        - For each node, the flow chart looks up whether or not we have a save for that node for this
                            ID, and that determines whether we can load it or not

                        - The two big unknowns:
                            - Can I create a save with an ID?
                            - Can I hide these saves from the interface?
                                - Given that I'm planning to do a bit of a custom save screen, this is prolly not too
                                    difficult
            - Write out the script for the demo (AKA the prologue)
                - Playing as Jack
                - Scam Barbara as part of a tutorial on psychic abilities
                - Choose which place to go to afterwards, with the mention that he can only go to one of them.
                - Get killed by Docherty
            - Draw up sprites for Jack, Barbara, Docherty (?)
            - Draw up CG
            - Customise GUI
                - Yellow/black scheme
                - Custom main menu with Jack doing the fingers to forehead thing and looking smug
                - Let's assume we're doing a custom pause menu for now (like what I did for AN) but I'll sort it out once I'm working on it
            - Add in SFX, placeholder music
        - Write up Google Docco with ze plan for friends to assess
            - Also do a Google Forms feedback thingy?
        - Send to friends with link to Google Docco
