BLACKMIND TODO
    - Demo Phase
        - Delivery Date: 31/08/2026
        - APPLY FOR FUNDING
        - Prototype Actionables:
            - Change play_sound to allow for a transition to be passed in, so we can do a red flash and pause at the same time
            - Change it so that Jack gets shot - that way I don't need to buy a stock blood splatter clip, and I can say that Lloyd hears the gunshots and that gets him running towards where Jack is 
            - Functionality for sliding the history window in/out (?)
            - What if I had a PC-98 style window, so we have all this functionality on the outside and just a little square for the scene? Would that work?

            - "Grammatical nitpick: the full stop should be inside the brackets for (“She’s definitely watered the bloody thing down, but not as much as some of the other places I’ve been to lately).”"
            - Zener card animation since MC thinks it gets disorientating:
                - slower card movement
                - same number of rows of cards, less cards per row
                - less rows of cards/more spaces between them
                - less rows of cards but slightly larger cards
                - alternating large/small card rows
            - Change it so that we go back to using the menu tag for everything, and if we return to the main menu from one of its submenus, we enter a state where the menu's already shrunken and 
                the items are in place. I can also prolly do some controls for the extras menu.
            - "UI complaint: The progress bar looks identical to the vertical scroll bar. Obvious it’s not a scroll bar when you interact because there’s no need and it does nothing, but not sure 
                I like the matching design language for different purposes."
                - What if we added lines to it, sort of like a ruler? Then even if it's the same colour it helps make it look different (and for bonus points, it helps you get a better sense of
                    how far you are through it)
            - "Not sure I like the shrinking head effect. Looks like what you’re doing is just outlining the border of it in yellow? I think it’d look better with a border surrounding it outside 
                the icon rather than an inline-border."
            - "I think the choice select menu should let you double back to the text log; even if that’s just a button or hover in the corner to pop it in/out."
            - MC pointed out issues with the log and lines repeating. What if I did a thing wherein if you read a mind, a button appears next to that line in the log, and hovering over it displays
                the corresponding thought?
                - Should check what Ace Attorney does if you keep pressing the same statement.
                - MC also raised the idea of reading an already-read line displaying an icon, and that displays the corresponding thought (prolly where I got the idea from).
            - Might be worth increasing the length of the progress bar instead of resetting it, so that it's apparent that when it's at 0%, that's the start of where you'll rewind back to
            - Fix it up so that when you have a location to go to and return to the location list, it doesn't have the one second delay
            - "[In choosing to mind-read] You’ve got what’s essentially a second set of dialogue for every conversation. [...] You want that part to be as fluid as possible."

        - Deliverables:
            - Logo
                - Get feedback on whether it looks good
            - Sprites
                - Do I need anything else for Jack, Barbara, Docherty?
                - Any objections to using Mason?
            - Backgrounds
                - Should work out placeholder art for all of it, then post an ad ASAP
            - Voice acting
                - Should work this out for the demo characters sooner rather than later
            - Music
                - Check feedback on the tone of the demo's music
                - Work out what music I want. One track per location is a start, but then I think I also need to do a few variants for different types of neutral, different types of comedy, and so on.
            - CGs
                - Bare minimum of one CG for the prologue + one per branch, but realistically I think we've got a few other good moments in each branch - prolly won't end up at one per day, but two or
                    three per branch would be fine.
                    - Though if we do one per day that's 11 total, so throw in another for the vision of Sergei dying and we have 12, which doesn't feel too ridiculous.
