        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - Audio:
                - SFX:
                    - Add in audio after the script's been updooted 
                        - running will need to be shortened

            - Script:
                - Current issues:
                    - Jack's death scene is a bit iffy; I think that him justifying leaving people with somebody who's potentially 
                        going to kill them works well on both the comedy and "wow he's really trying hard to justify this" levels,
                        but him being all like "yep this is fine, I'll be safe" doesn't really work. I was aiming for surprising people
                        with the sudden death, but I don't think that it works - we can assume that he'll die, or at the very least
                        come into actual contact with the threat and then escape, so him going "oh wow I deffo felt like I was about
                        to die; good thing that I didn't!" feels incredibly obvious that it's not the end of things. So the intended,
                        "you thought that he had escaped but he didn't! Dun dun dun!" doesn't really work.
                        - SOLUTION: Change this so we emphasise the feeling of the knife from his precognition, and how scared he is. 
                            Have him hallucinate blood even after he knows that it's his precognition, and have him panicking more regardless.
                            Focus on his fear and his panic, and portray it as dramatic, rather than, "Oh my god! Lmao time to run, nah
                            she'll be right." I think the latter does kind of work in-character, but it hurts the story, so therefore
                            portraying him as panicking and scared more is the bigger benefit (and is still in-character).
                    - I don't like that the restaurant and the venue both lead to essentially the same scene - it shows that there's no 
                        difference between them, and while this wouldn't be an issue in the full version if somebody kept playing and
                        decided to save the other location for their next playthrough, in the demo it hurts it quite a lot, and might
                        imply that you're on a pretty fucking linear path (which, to be fair, you are, although the more I can obscure
                        that fact the better).
                        - SOLUTION: 
                            - Let's go:
                                - Music Venue:
                                    - Jack (or the narrator) exposits about how his powers emerged in his teens 
                                    - He has no idea where they came from
                                    - Jack's planning to use his powers to get a shittonne of money and then he has "big plans" for what to do

                                - Restaurant:
                                    - Jack (or the narrator) exposits about how Jack currently doesn't have a job
                                    - He thinks about how he has no regrets in scamming Barbara, about it's every man for themselves; she would have done the same
                                    - Jack thinks about how he's found out some very interesting information lately, "thanks to that detective"
        - Work out a plan for applying for funding while I'm waiting on feedback
