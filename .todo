        - Delivery Date: 31/12/2025
        - TODO List:
            - Audio:
                - SFX:
                    - Add in audio after the script's been updooted 
                        - running will need to be shortened

            - Script:
                - Could an omniscient narrator help with things? I don't want Jack to narrate, but an omniscient narrator might
                    solve some of the problems that I've got.
                - Current issues:
                    - The opening hook isn't amazing atm. The bit on the prologue screen about Jack thinking about how to use his
                        psychic abilities is a nice tease, and I think it piques your interest, but we then lose it with Jack until
                        he actually uses the psychic abilities. Lean more into them from the start; they're the hook, and there's 
                        no reason not to mention them from the start.
                        - SOLUTION: I've already got it, and that's that Jack's thinking about how to use his psychic abilities.
                            Instead of him looking at Barbara and thinking "would", it can be that he's only just finished a drink
                            and is wondering about what he can say to Barbara to get her to hand him over some cash. It makes him
                            a little bit more calculating, but I think that if I keep his speech patterns it'll work well enough.
                    - I looked to Jeremy for inspo as to how to write somebody who's a shit but entertaining, and I think that it
                        worked out fairly well overall, but the problem is that I wrote him as being too much like Jeremy - he's
                        thinking about sex more than I think Jack should be, and I don't like it. It feels like the wrong priority
                        to focus on, and what's more, him thinking about sex combined with his general lack of morals has an undertone
                        of "has he used his powers to rape women?"
                        - SOLUTION: Tying into the above - instead of thinking about how much he wants to bang Barbara, he's thinking
                            about how he can scam her. I'll need to emphasise that he's a bit of a loser - he can't keep a job,
                            he's behind on rent - and make it clear that it's his own fault, that he's _sure_ that there's a way
                            for his psychic abilities to make life easy for him! He just...needs to work out what that is.
                    - Jack's death scene is a bit iffy; I think that him justifying leaving people with somebody who's potentially 
                        going to kill them works well on both the comedy and "wow he's really trying hard to justify this" levels,
                        but him being all like "yep this is fine, I'll be safe" doesn't really work. I was aiming for surprising people
                        with the sudden death, but I don't think that it works - we can assume that he'll die, or at the very least
                        come into actual contact with the threat and then escape, so him going "oh wow I deffo felt like I was about
                        to die; good thing that I didn't!" feels incredibly obvious that it's not the end of things. So the intended,
                        "you thought that he had escaped but he didn't! Dun dun dun!" doesn't really work.
                        - SOLUTION: Change this so we emphasise the feeling of the knife from his precognition, and how scared he is. 
                            Have him hallucinate blood even after he knows that it's his precognition, and have him panicking more regardless.
                            Focus on his fear and his panic, and portray it as dramatic, rather than, "Oh my god! Lmao time to run, nah
                            she'll be right." I think the latter does kind of work in-character, but it hurts the story, so therefore
                            portraying him as panicking and scared more is the bigger benefit (and is still in-character).
                    - I don't like that the restaurant and the venue both lead to essentially the same scene - it shows that there's no 
                        difference between them, and while this wouldn't be an issue in the full version if somebody kept playing and
                        decided to save the other location for their next playthrough, in the demo it hurts it quite a lot, and might
                        imply that you're on a pretty fucking linear path (which, to be fair, you are, although the more I can obscure
                        that fact the better).
                        - SOLUTION: What do we need this scene to have, and what can we have variations with?
                            - Infodump about Jack:
                                - He's had his psychic powers since he was in his teens
                                - He has no idea where they came from
                                - He's kind of a loser who hasn't 100% grown up
                            - Precognition flash of getting killed
                            - Run away, actually get killed

                                - I can squeeze something unique in between the infodump and the precognition. If this were the main game,
                                    the differences in where you go would be who you're seeing and therefore the information that you can
                                    get which determines which branch you're one, as well as information that builds up to the ending.
                                    With that in mind, I think the best solution is to split the current Jack backstory in half between the
                                    two: one location has him thinking about his psychic powers emerging and that he doesn't know where they
                                    came from, the other has him thinking about his current life, and we get a bit of exposition of what he's
                                    up to.
                                    - Alternatively alternatively, I could red herring it, and in each he thinks about something that seems
                                        like it'll be important. That might be a better idea, so it makes the death feel more unex-spec-ted.
                                        With that in mind, while Docherty targeting psychics isn't a massive twist, it's certainly the core
                                        of the knowledge that we get from Branch A, so let's swerve away from it a bit so that the reveal feels
                                        a bit more engaging. Namely, I'll change it so that instead of saying that Jack is the source, Docherty
                                        says something along the lines of "I apologise for this, but you are in the way of my plan," (which in
                                        turn means that Killian is prolly controlling him fairly 1:1). In turn, this means that on both paths,
                                        Jack needs to mention _something_ that he's doing, or is a part of, which he could implicitly be affecting.
                                        Bonus points if it's something that Sergei could also potentially be a part of, although that will be
                                        harder to do since in Branch A we'll only get an image of him.
                                    - TL;DR: Jack is implied to be part of [TWO SOMETHINGS], one per location, which Docherty is implicitly
                                        killing him because of. Potential murder motivations:
                                        - Inheritance - getting money if relatives are out of the way
                                        - Revenge
                                        - Money - killing somebody gives you the opportunity to make a tonne of money
                                        - Silencing somebody who knows something that you don't want them to
                                        - Killing them will stop them from doing something you don't want them to
        - Work out a plan for applying for funding while I'm waiting on feedback
